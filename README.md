DESCRIPTION:
This C++ program is a command-line calculator that interprets and evaluates mathematical expressions using a two-step process: it first converts infix expressions to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) using the Shunting Yard algorithm and then evaluates the resulting postfix expression. The code begins with the inclusion of essential headers such as <iostream>, <stack>, <sstream>, <string>, <cctype>, <map>, <vector>, and <stdexcept>, all of which are necessary for handling input, managing data structures, and throwing exceptions. The calculator operates by accepting an expression as a string input from the user and processing it in the evaluate_expression() function, which internally calls two key functions: infix_to_postfix() and evaluate_postfix(). The infix_to_postfix() function parses the infix expression character by character, using a stack to handle operators and parentheses, while respecting operator precedence and associativity. It also uses a buffer to build numeric values, including decimal numbers, and pushes them into a vector of strings representing the postfix expression. This vector is then passed to evaluate_postfix(), which uses another stack to compute the result by scanning through the tokens and applying operators to the top values of the stack when encountered. The calculator correctly handles basic arithmetic operators—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—and includes error detection for invalid characters, mismatched parentheses, division by zero, and malformed expressions. Notably, the function apply_operator() contains a safety check for division to avoid runtime crashes, throwing a descriptive exception if division by zero is attempted. The main loop of the program, contained within the main() function, displays a prompt and continuously reads input from the user until the keyword "exit" is entered. It gracefully handles user errors by catching exceptions and printing informative error messages without terminating the program, thus offering a resilient user experience. The logic also checks for empty lines and ignores them, allowing a smooth flow of repeated calculations. The use of stack from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) allows for efficient and logical handling of the nested structure of expressions and operator precedence. Additionally, vector<string> is used to store the postfix tokens, making token management simple and flexible. Overall, this calculator provides an elegant and minimalistic solution for expression parsing and evaluation in C++, demonstrating the power of classic algorithms like the Shunting Yard method, along with modern C++ exception handling and standard library utilities. Though it does not use a full parser class or grammar rules, it is capable of evaluating expressions with parentheses, mixed operators, and negative numbers when properly formatted. The modular structure of the program makes it easy to maintain and extend—for example, by adding support for more operators, functions like square root or power, or even variables and memory storage. In essence, this program combines fundamental data structures, control flow, and error handling into a practical utility that showcases expression evaluation—a foundational concept in interpreters, compilers, and computational mathematics applications.
